### Club Event Handler

<h4>Major Project for B.Tech</h4>
<p>
Club Event Handler is "Content Management System" in which we can handle every event or recruitment in different clubs of a college or school. <br>
Club Members (Authorised) can "Post" any information or circular regarding any event with respect to their clubs. <br>
College or School students can "Download" circular file and can get the details form the clubs they are interested in and can apply for the same directly from the page and participate in it. <br>
In this project students also have ability to apply for "Club Positions" like President, Vice President, Secretary, Joint Secretary, Treasurer. <br>
