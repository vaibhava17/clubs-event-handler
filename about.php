        <h5 class="" style="color: white;">Shri Siddhi Vinayak. Co-curricular activities help students to develop problem-solving, reasoning, critical thinking, creative thinking, communication and collaborative abilities. The importance of co-curricular activities is immense. Therefore, we bring a platform where students can explore from pin to plane of our college co-curricular activities. On this platform, students can get to know about all the information regarding various Abhiruchi clubs, Abhiruchi interviews, screenings, events(like Invertia and Mascot) and other competitions. Participation helps students in emotional development, social skill development and overall personality development. This is why our platform also allows students to enroll themselves in any of these activities as per their interest using this particular website.
